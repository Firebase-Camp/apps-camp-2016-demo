# Firebase: Build a Real Time Web Chat App Codelab - Final code

This folder contains the final code of the [Firebase: Build a Real Time Web Chat App Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/firebase-web/).

You can use this app directly if you'd like to see the finished app but before you do follow the "Create a Firebase Project and Setup" step of the [Codelab instructions](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/firebase-web/)
 
Before deploying make sure you change the `<STORAGE_BUCKET>` placeholder in the [storage.rules](./storage.rules) file. 
 
If you'd like to follow the step by step codelab start with the [web-start](../web-start) directory.
